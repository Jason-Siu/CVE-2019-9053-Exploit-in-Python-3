# CVE-2019-9053-Exploit-in-Python-3

This is an exploit used in [TryHackMe's EasyCTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf)

However the code that is installed within Kali Linux or going to exploitDB has outdated Python 2 code.

This is a rewrite of that, and some revisions were made when cracking the password's hash.

This is so that you can run the EasyCTF the way it's intended to without any errors.
